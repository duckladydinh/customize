# Customize

A number of scripts bundled into a single Chrome extension to automate repeatitive tasks on the web.

## Web navigator

This is a Chrome Extension v3 sequel to [WeMap](https://github.com/duckladydinh/wemap). In detail, it's a collection of quick links that that allows me to, for example, type the short link `ai/` into the address bar, enter and jump to https://chatgpt.com. There are just a couple of websites I visit very often and this ability is a superpower.

## Others

Too lazy to list them out for now.
